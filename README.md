tktr - A CLI task tracker.
====

It is quite obvious that same amount of features could have been accomplished with far less effort.
The tktr does not have such a goal. It's actually targeted to get some hands-on with C++11 features.

Anyway, the below features should persist in the final version:

- create and complete tasks;
- pomodoro-like interaction with tasks: trigger active state and track time spent on a task.
